##### I was born in Belarus in Kalinkovichi town in 1994. I graduated from the local gymnasium in 2011. This year I entered the Gomel State University named after P.O. Sukhoi at the Faculty of Energy. In 2016, I completed my bachelor's degree and entered the master's degree in the same specialty at the same university. In 2018, I continued my studies already in graduate school.
##### Since childhood, I have loved to do everything related to computers and technology. I have no development experience. But I've always had a bit of a connection to it. I love flashing different devices. Change the program code. As a child, I had the experience of creating a server for the Lineage 2 game based on Java and MySQL.
##### Now I work as a shift supervisor for a power plant in the electrical department. Since 2016, this is my only place of work.
##### There were attempts to study PYTHON, but it became uninteresting because the result of the work was not visible.
##### My level of English is upper-Intermediate.
##### I can work in stressful situations. I am sociable and friendly. I love to learn something new and develop. My soft skills are still better than development skills. But this is temporary :) 
* I have basic knowledge in areas such as: 
    * HTML, 
    * CSS, 
    * GIT.
